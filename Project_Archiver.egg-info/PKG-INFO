        ###How to use<a name="How-to-use"></a>
        
        Launch Fusion 360.
        Under the **Scripts and Addins** select Arcive-export.
        In the data panel navigate to the project you want to archive.
        The add-in will export all Fusion 360 files in the active project.
        
        ![](Project-Archiver/resources/dialog.png)
        
        The dialog shows you the **Project to Archive** which is the current active project.
        
        It then allows you to enter a path. Type in a path into the **Output Path** field.
        * For OSX this might be: **/Users/*username*/Desktop/Test/**
        * For Windows this might be something like **C:\Test**
        
        Finally under **Export Types** select the different files types you want to export.  You can select multiple types.
        
        Click **OK**.
        
        Fusion will open and export each 3D design. Depending on the size of design and bandwidth this can take some time. 
        Fusion 360 will be busy for the duration of the script running, so it would be advisable to run this on a dedicated machine that you can leav to run for some time.
